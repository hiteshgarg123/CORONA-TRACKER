      "question": "What is COVID-19?",
      "answer":
          "COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. 'CO' stands for corona, 'VI' for virus, and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as '2019 novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV.'"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
      "answer":
          "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does COVID-19 spread?",
      "answer":
          "SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread from person to person through droplets produced during coughing or breathing during close contact with an infected individual. Infection can also occur indirect contact when these droplets land on objects and surfaces around the infected individual and the other person touches these objects or surfaces, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. This is why it is important to stay at least 1-2 meters (3-6 feet) away from a person who is sick. Given that some individuals have no symptoms while still infected with the virus, physical distancing of 1-2 meters should be observed regardless of whether the other person seems sick."
    },
    {
      "question":
          "Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?",
      "answer":
          "Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?” Aerosols may be generated during certain medical procedures and other activities, such as singing, but are not considered the predominant route of spread for this infection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the virus survive on surfaces?",
      "answer":
          "It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment). If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Cleaning your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water is very important. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
    },
    {
      "question":
          "Is there a connection between COVID -19 and environment temperature?",
      "answer":
          "It does not seem likely that temperature changes impact or have any connection with COVID-19. COVID-19 cases have been seen in all seasons and all countries and continents in the world."
    },
    {
      "question": "How likely am I to catch COVID-19?",
      "answer":
          "The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve globally. To date, all countries and continents have reported cases. Make sure you are aware of the local situation in your country and duty station."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I worry about COVID-19?",
      "answer":
          "COVID-19 should be taken seriously and vigilance is required. While illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild in most infected, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing, physical distancing, mask use and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is at risk of developing severe illness?",
      "answer":
          "Those at most risk of severe illness are those aged 60 and above and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity ad cancer. Although these groups are at highest risk, severe illness and death have been described even in those without these risk factors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I wear a mask to protect myself?",
      "answer":
          "Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive strategy of measures to suppress transmission and save lives; the use of a mask alone is not sufficient to provide an adequate level of protection against COVID-19. If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all! Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use, storage and cleaning or disposal of masks are essential to make them as effective as possible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I wear a mask while exercising?",
      "answer":
          "The WHO recommends that masks not be worn during vigorous physical activity. Please ensure a 1-2-meter distance from others when exercising and that there is adequate ventilation."
    },
    {
      "question":
          "Can humans become infected with COVID-19 from an animal source?",
      "answer":
          "Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed though are postulated. To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
    },
    {
      "question":
          "How long is the incubation and transmission period for COVID-19?",
      "answer":
          "The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. The transmission period refers to the period where you can spread infection to someone else which is currently 48 hours before symptom onset to 14 days after symptom resolution, or date of test in those who were asymptomatic."
    },
    {
      "question":
          "Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?",
      "answer":
          "Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. Since COVID-19 is a virus, antibiotics are not indicated for the direct treatment. However, it may be required in some instances, such as for treating secondary bacterial infections."
